Given an array A of n integers and two integers a and b which belongs to the given array. Write
a program to create a Binary Search Tree T by inserting the elements from A[0] to A[n − 1] and
find the maximum element in the path from a to b. Assume that the elements a and b are present
in T.


Note: Each node of the BST is of the following type:

struct node {
int data;
struct node *leftChild;
struct node *rightChild;
};


Example:
A= 18, 36, 9, 6, 12, 10, 1, 8 ,
a = 1, b = 10.
The maximum element in the path from 1 to 10 is 12. (Refer figure)

Input Format:
• First line of the input contains n integers separated by a space representing the elements of
array. The integers are in the range [−106
, 106
].
• Second line of the input contains two integers a and b.

Output Format:
• Single line that contains the maximum element in the path from a to b.


Sample Input:
18 36 9 6 12 10 1 8
1 10

Sample Output:
12
