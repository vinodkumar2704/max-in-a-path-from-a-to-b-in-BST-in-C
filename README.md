#Finding maximum element in a path from a to b in a BST in C.


 Given an array A of n integers and two integers a and b which belongs to the given array. Write
a program to create a Binary Search Tree T by inserting the elements from A[0] to A[n âˆ’ 1] and
find the maximum element in the path from a to b. Assume that the elements a and b are present
in T.
